#+TITLE: Clog Evaluation Framework

The main task of this framework is run the Clang Static Analyzer and Clog on the
same codebase and measure differences between them regarding:
- report quality
- runtime performance (time, memory usage)

* How to run
#+BEGIN_SRC
cd framework

PATH=/work/projects/llvm-project/build-release/bin/:$PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/work/projects/llvm-project/build-release/lib \
stack  run -- --srcdir /work/projects/juliet/C \
--juliet-dir testcases/CWE457_Use_of_Uninitialized_Variable/ \
--jar /work/projects/metadl/compiler.jar \
 --clog-program ../clog-programs \
--juliet-filter "CWE457.*c

#+END_SRC

Since ~--juliet-filter~ selects which reports from the ground truth to compare against, it is important that it refers to same tests as the ones pointed to by ~--juliet-dir~.
